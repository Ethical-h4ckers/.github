   ***This is a free and open source project made by few students and anyone intrested sharing 
hacking or linux skill or anyone willing to learn hacking are wellcome here***
     ***We all know what hacking is and we've seen lot of hacker in movies right? the one always with masks and they just press one key and the system is hacked . That's not realy how things work a simple simple scan can even take more than the whole movie(depents on what your scanning).Inorder to be a hacker (or just to know how it works) we should at least know about linux and how to execute a command, becouse now days everything is available on github from simple phishing scripts to whole hacking framework, Hacking using those scripts still make you a hacker but you will be known as a "script kiddie" (the person who plays with scripts) and who does not even know what he is doing***
